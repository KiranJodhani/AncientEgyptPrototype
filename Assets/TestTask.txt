Task to create a hypercasual game about ancient Egypt 
Your task is to come up with and implement a simple game about ancient Egypt, which will be developed in Unity 2021.3.
The game should include elements related to pyramids, pharaohs, sand, and crystals, but should not be a runner game.

You choose the main mechanics yourself, it is advisable to choose a non-popular mechanics

It is important that the game has the following elements:
a simple, but understandable tutorial;
a victory/defeat window (if applicable);
a pleasant visual;
controls that would work both in the editor and on mobile devices.

To implement the game, we recommend using the following tools:
DoTween - a free plugin for creating animations from code;
Cinemachine - an embedded Unity tool for convenient camera settings and behaviors;
Unity Recorder - an embedded Unity tool for recording video;
Text Mesh Pro - a replacement for standard text in Unity with many advantages;
Mixamo - a free tool from Adobe for quick work with humanoid animations.

Additional wishes:
the UI Canvas should be in Screen Space and adapt to different resolutions (from 5:3 to 18:9);
values should be configurable in the inspector (or in Scriptable Objects);
there should be a clear hierarchy of objects on the scene;
prefabs and prefab variants should be used;
there is no need to refine and polish animations from Mixamo - it is enough to find the most suitable ones.

It is very important to make a prototype that is enjoyable to play. To do this, it is necessary to pay attention to the
following elements:

optimization (if there is no good FPS, then the game will simply be unpleasant to play, even if it is perfect in terms of gameplay);
camera (it is necessary to create a smooth and convenient camera that will allow the player to easily observe
everything that is happening).

Recommended to spend no more than 2 days
